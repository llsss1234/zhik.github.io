<h2>A few things about myself:</h2>
        
<p>I love programming, data and GIS. I am studying Geography at Hunter College and currently a College Aid at the DOT. </p>

<p><a href="{{ site.url }}/resume.pdf">resume</a></p>

<p>I don't have many hobbies (sometimes I bike) But I like helping out and teaching others programming.</p>
  
<p>My last github pages broke and I didn't want to spend to much to reconfig it, I will keep this simple one and <strong>start writing (blogs and tutorials), be more social :) and develop my thoughts and skills.</strong> </p>
        
<p>I will try to keep most of it short and to the point. hopefully I post often.</p>
